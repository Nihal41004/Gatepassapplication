# Gate Pass Application

## Abstract

This Java program is a simple Gate Pass Application that facilitates the issuance of gate passes to students and employees. It also provides functionality to manage user details such as adding, updating, and deleting users in a MySQL database.

## Classes Overview

1. **User**: Base class representing a general user with attributes for name and ID.
2. **Admin**: Represents an admin who can issue gate passes, with attributes for name and ID.
3. **Employee**: Extends `User` and represents an employee with inherited name and ID attributes.
4. **Student**: Extends `User` and represents a student with additional attributes for course and year.
5. **GatePass**: Represents a gate pass issued to a user, containing the user (employee or student) and the purpose of the gate pass.
6. **GatePassApplication**: Main class driving the Gate Pass Application, with methods to interact with a MySQL database (connect, retrieve user details, add/update/delete users), issue gate passes, and provide a console-based menu for user interaction.

## Program Flow

1. The program establishes a connection to a MySQL database using JDBC.
2. Users are presented with a menu of options to choose from.
3. The program executes corresponding functionalities based on user choices (e.g., issue gate pass, add/update/delete student/employee).
4. Users can choose to exit the program, which closes the database connection and terminates the application.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a MySQL database and update the JDBC connection details in `GatePassApplication.java`.
3. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac GatePassApplication.java`).
4. Run the compiled program (e.g., `java GatePassApplication`).
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the Gate Pass Application.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure proper input validation and error handling for a robust application.
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for admin functionalities.
- Maintain clear and concise code documentation for future reference and maintenance.
